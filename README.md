# About me
Hi, I'm Ram 👋

I'm a graduate data scientist currently completing an MSc in Data Science at LSE.
My interests include applied machine learning, NLP, scalable data pipelines,
and using data to support real-world decision making.

This profile highlights a small number of projects that reflect:
- Working with large, messy datasets
- Building reproducible ML workflows
- Emphasising interpretability and robustness

This is a short about me and lets connect for fruitful learning !!!!
